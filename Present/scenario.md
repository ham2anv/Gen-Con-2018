# Trigram: Present
A band of rebellious heroes deal with magical fallout when agents of a forgotten monarch launch a desperate bid to destroy modern Hong Kong.

## Adventure Synopsis
We begin in medias res as the heroes chase members of the Eight Fires Triad through the streets of Central. The Dragons have been tangling with the Triad for months as the gang performed a series of increasingly dangerous crimes and the Hong Kong police turned a blind eye.

The chase ends with the Triad setting off
