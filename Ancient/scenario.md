# Trigram: Ancient

## Adventure Synopsis
Li Ting needs a ritual sacrifice to refire a Netherworld forge that creates unnatural weapons. For obscure astrological reasons, he has chosen Magistrate Shen Yue.

Shen Yue has pursued all of the player characters for various reasons (leading to individual melodramatic hooks). The Magistrate is marrying Gao Baiwei in a public ceremony in the town square on the night of the adventure.

Li Ting sends his general Abundant Gate, lieutenants, and many demons to capture Shen and bring him into the Netherworld for the sacrifice.
